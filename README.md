# Advanced-MNIST-Digit-Recognition
This project focuses on accurately classifying handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset using an advanced deep learning model. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training and 10,000 testing grayscale images (28x28 pixels each).
## Overview:
I performed data preprocessing (normalizing pixel values) to prepare inputs for the neural network.
An enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was built with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers to extract features effectively.
The model was trained using the Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy loss function, and tuned hyperparameters like epochs and batch size to optimize performance.

## Key Highlights:
Deep CNN model architecture with multiple Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense layers.Achieved ~99.5% training accuracy and ~99.2% test accuracy. Visualized predictions on test images, showing highly accurate digit classification.
Very low loss value, indicating almost no overfitting or underfitting.

## Final Results:
Training Accuracy: ~99.5%
Testing Accuracy: ~99.2%
Misclassification Rate: Less than 1%

## Conclusion: 
The model generalizes extremely well, making it highly reliable for real-world handwritten digit recognition tasks.
